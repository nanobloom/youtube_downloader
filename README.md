Hey everyone, I'm Filip and this is my first project. Main purpose is to get familiar and learn GitHub and practice programming in general but I think it might be actually useful for the community at the same time so for that reason I decided to share it.



What the project does?

- It's a downloader that lets user download videos from youtube (as the name suggests ^^) using pytube and youtube_dl libraries
- Has a simple user interface built using Tkinter
- User has a choice of downloading video (best available quality .mp4), song (best available quality .mp3) or entire playlist of videos
- Everything is downloaded into "downloads" folder created on first use
- Logging system is also added so that user can keep track on when exactly specific video/song/playlist has been downloaded



How to use it?

Using the program is as simple as running the code, waiting for tkinter window to pop up, selecting the type of file/s you want to download, pasting the link and clicking download. Download is completed as soon as the pasted link disappears.



Who maintains and contributes to the project ?

Well for now it's just me and the project is pretty much my learning ground. If anyone is actually interested in using the program or even contributing, I'm gonna definitely figure out how to make it possible for people to contribute but for now I'm fairly new to GitHub and programming world in general so just give me some time to get used to how things are done here ^^


My future plans related to project:

Adding anything that might be useful and I've got a couple of ideas:
- Prettifying user interface because visuals are pretty much untouched yet
- Adding some additional features like downloading a playlist of .mp3's instead of .mp4's or maybe choosing specific range of videos/song in a playlist
- Trying to figure out which of the modules/libraries/functions/anything might be useful so I can learn how to implement these
- Also making this readme more readable as it seems too clustered

Suggestions/ideas:

I'm thankful for any ideas, suggestions, opinions, bug reports and criticism that you might have about the project but I'm still not entirely sure about how can I read them here, as soon as I figure that out I'm gonna start taking them into account and doing my best to improve my project accordingly.

Thanks:

Even though It's just a start for me, project is really basic, could be created by experienced people in minutes and I don't consider it anything worthy compared to all the amazing stuff you people are sharing everyday, I have to emphasize that I'm exceptionally thankful for all the knowledge that people shared with me so that I could start my programming journey. I'm referring to countless people from places like reddit programming subforums, stackoverflow, youtube videos and comment sections, standalone websites with tutorials, hints and tips and everyone contributing to open-source in general. I promise to always use my code for good and do my best to turn all that knowledge into actually something useful one day that everyone will be able to use and do amazing stuff with for free.
